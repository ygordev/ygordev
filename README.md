## 💼 What do I do?
I'm currently working as a Brazilian Navy Officer, first lieutenant. Currently involved in planning and electronics maintenance. As side hustle, i like to build mobile apps (Flutter SDK) and develop solutions to day-to-day problems, using tools like Python and Arduino. Aditicionally, I got some skills on Graphics Design, using Illustrator, Photoshop and After Effects (Motion Design). Those skills helps me at UX/UI design, creating social media content and advertising.

## ✒️ Blog & Writing 
I started a project called 'Laboratório de Bits', where I write about Electronics and Computer Programming to newbies, using easy-to-understand language and easy-to-consume content. I'm also accepting suggestions about content.
